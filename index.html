            <p id="p1">Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two
                different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two
                lines. Due to foreshortening, nearby objects show a larger parallax than farther objects when
                observed from different positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances.

                To measure large distances, such as the distance of a planet or a star from Earth, astronomers use the
                principle of parallax. Here, the term parallax is the semi-angle of inclination between two sight-lines
                to the star, as observed when Earth is on opposite sides of the Sun in its orbit. These distances
                form the lowest rung of what is called "the cosmic distance ladder", the first in a succession of
                methods by which astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects, serving as a basis for other
                distance measurements in astronomy forming the higher rungs of the ladder.

                Parallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes, binoculars, microscopes, and twin-lens
                reflex cameras that view objects from slightly different angles. Many animals, along with humans, have
                two eyes with overlapping visual fields that use parallax to gain depth perception; this process is
                known as stereopsis. In computer vision the effect is used for computer stereo vision, and there is a
                device called a parallax rangefinder that uses it to find range, and in some variations also altitude to
                a target.

                A simple everyday example of parallax can be seen in the dashboard of motor vehicles that use a
                needle-style non-LCD speedometer gauge. When viewed from directly in front, the speed may show exactly
                60, but when viewed from the passenger seat, the needle may appear to show a slightly different speed,
                due to the angle of viewing.

            <h3 id='h2'>Stellar Parallax</h3>
            <p id="p2">Stellar parallax created by the relative motion between the Earth and a star can be seen, in the
                Copernican model, as arising from the orbit of the Earth around the Sun: the star only appears to move
                relative to more distant objects in the sky. In a geostatic model, the movement of the star would have
                to be taken as real with the star oscillating across the sky with respect to the background stars.

                Stellar parallax is most often measured using annual parallax, defined as the difference in position of
                a star as seen from the Earth and Sun, i.e. the angle subtended at a star by the mean radius of the
                Earth's orbit around the Sun. The parsec (3.26 light-years) is defined as the distance for which the
                annual parallax is 1 arcsecond. Annual parallax is normally measured by observing the position of a star
                at different times of the year as the Earth moves through its orbit. Measurement of annual parallax was
                the first reliable way to determine the distances to the closest stars. The first successful
                measurements of stellar parallax were made by Friedrich Bessel in 1838 for the star 61 Cygni using a
                heliometer.[5] Stellar parallax remains the standard for calibrating other measurement methods. Accurate
                calculations of distance based on stellar parallax require a measurement of the distance from the Earth
                to the Sun, now based on radar reflection off the surfaces of planets.[6]

                The angles involved in these calculations are very small and thus difficult to measure. The nearest star
                to the Sun (and thus the star with the largest parallax), Proxima Centauri, has a parallax of 0.7687 Â±
                0.0003 arcsec.[7] This angle is approximately that subtended by an object 2 centimeters in diameter
                located 5.3 kilometers away.</p>

            <h3 id="h3">Optical Sight</h3>
            <p id="p3">Parallax error can be seen when taking photos with many types of cameras, such as twin-lens
                reflex cameras and those including viewfinders (such as rangefinder cameras). In such cameras, the eye
                sees the subject through different optics (the viewfinder, or a second lens) than the one through which
                the photo is taken. As the viewfinder is often found above the lens of the camera, photos with parallax
                error are often slightly lower than intended, the classic example being the image of person with their
                head cropped off. This problem is addressed in single-lens reflex cameras, in which the viewfinder sees
                through the same lens through which the photo is taken (with the aid of a movable mirror), thus avoiding
                parallax error.
                Parallax is also an issue in image stitching, such as for panoramas.
                In some reticled optical instruments such as telescopes, microscopes or in telescopic sights ("scopes")
                used on small arms and theodolites, parallax can create problems when the reticle is not coincident with
                the focal plane of the target image. This is because when the reticle and the target are not at the same
                focus, the optically corresponded distances being projected through the eyepiece are also different, and
                the user's eye will register the difference in parallaxes between the reticle and the target (whenever
                eye position changes) as a relative displacement on top of each other. The term parallax shift refers to
                that resultant apparent "floating" movements of the reticle over the target image when the user moves
                his/her head/eye laterally (up/down or left/right) behind the sight,[32] i.e. an error where the reticle
                does not stay aligned with the user's optical axis.
